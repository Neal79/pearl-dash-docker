PHASE 3: ULTIMATE PERFORMANCE ARCHITECTURE
==========================================

Overview: Replace Node.js WebSocket service with native PHP ReactPHP WebSocket server
Timeline: 1-2 months development effort
Target: 100+ devices, enterprise-grade performance

CURRENT ARCHITECTURE (Phase 2)
==============================
Laravel PHP ←→ HTTP Bridge ←→ Node.js WebSocket Service ←→ Frontend Clients

Problems at Scale (100+ devices):
- 600+ HTTP calls/second between PHP and Node.js
- Dual process management complexity
- Network latency on every event (10-50ms overhead)
- Memory overhead from running two separate services
- Inter-process communication bottlenecks

PHASE 3 ARCHITECTURE
====================
Laravel PHP (with ReactPHP WebSocket) ←→ Frontend Clients

Benefits:
- Single-language stack (all PHP)
- Sub-100ms response times
- Direct memory operations (no HTTP bridge)
- Simplified deployment and monitoring
- Lower resource usage
- Enterprise-scale performance

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION
========================

1. ReactPHP WebSocket Server Integration
   - Use Ratchet/ReactPHP for WebSocket handling
   - Embed ReactPHP event loop in Laravel application
   - Handle WebSocket connections directly in PHP

2. Replace Current Node.js Service (media-proxy/realtime-data-service.js)
   - Port authentication system to ReactPHP
   - Migrate subscription management to PHP
   - Convert event broadcasting to ReactPHP patterns

3. Laravel Integration Points
   - Modify PearlDevicePoller to broadcast directly to ReactPHP
   - Remove HTTP webhook (pushEventToWebSocket method)
   - Use Laravel events with ReactPHP event listeners

RESEARCH AREAS
==============

1. ReactPHP + Laravel Integration
   - How to embed ReactPHP event loop in Laravel
   - Service provider patterns for WebSocket server
   - Artisan commands for WebSocket service management

2. Connection Management
   - ReactPHP handling 100+ concurrent WebSocket connections
   - Memory management for long-running PHP processes
   - Connection authentication and authorization

3. Performance Benchmarking
   - ReactPHP vs Node.js WebSocket performance
   - Memory usage patterns under load
   - Response time comparisons

4. Process Management
   - Running ReactPHP as systemd service
   - Graceful shutdowns and restarts
   - Health monitoring and auto-recovery

5. Horizontal Scaling (Future)
   - Load balancing WebSocket connections
   - Redis pub/sub for multi-server events
   - Session affinity for WebSocket connections

KEY LIBRARIES TO EVALUATE
=========================

Primary:
- ratchetphp/pawl (WebSocket client)
- ratchetphp/ratchet (WebSocket server)
- reactphp/socket (Low-level socket handling)
- reactphp/http (HTTP server integration)

Supporting:
- reactphp/promise (Async promise handling)
- reactphp/stream (Stream processing)
- react/zmq (ZeroMQ integration for scaling)

DEVELOPMENT PHASES
==================

Phase 3.1: Research & Prototyping (1-2 weeks)
- ReactPHP WebSocket proof of concept
- Laravel integration patterns
- Performance baseline testing

Phase 3.2: Core Implementation (2-3 weeks)
- Replace Node.js WebSocket service
- Implement authentication system
- Port subscription management

Phase 3.3: Laravel Integration (1-2 weeks)
- Update PearlDevicePoller event firing
- Remove HTTP bridge components
- Update configuration and environment

Phase 3.4: Testing & Optimization (1-2 weeks)
- Load testing with 100+ simulated devices
- Memory leak detection
- Performance tuning

Phase 3.5: Deployment & Migration (1 week)
- Production deployment strategy
- Rollback procedures
- Monitoring and alerting setup

MIGRATION STRATEGY
==================

1. Parallel Development
   - Keep Phase 2 system running
   - Develop Phase 3 alongside existing system
   - A/B test with subset of devices

2. Gradual Rollout
   - Start with test devices only
   - Monitor performance and stability
   - Gradually migrate production devices

3. Fallback Plan
   - Keep Phase 2 code as backup
   - Quick rollback procedures
   - Database compatibility maintained

PERFORMANCE TARGETS
===================

Current (Phase 2):
- Response time: 200-500ms
- Throughput: ~50 devices comfortably
- Memory: PHP + Node.js processes

Phase 3 Goals:
- Response time: 50-100ms
- Throughput: 100+ devices easily
- Memory: Single PHP process
- CPU: Lower overhead from eliminated HTTP bridge

MONITORING & METRICS
====================

Key metrics to track during Phase 3:
- WebSocket connection count and stability
- Event processing latency
- Memory usage over time
- CPU utilization patterns
- Database connection pooling efficiency

Tools:
- ReactPHP built-in metrics
- Laravel Telescope for debugging
- Prometheus/Grafana for monitoring
- New Relic/DataDog for APM

RISKS & MITIGATION
==================

Technical Risks:
- ReactPHP learning curve
- Long-running PHP process stability
- Memory leaks in event loop
- WebSocket connection handling edge cases

Mitigation:
- Extensive testing with simulated load
- Memory profiling and leak detection
- Gradual rollout with fallback options
- Community support and documentation review

Business Risks:
- Development time investment
- Potential service disruption during migration
- Team knowledge transfer requirements

Mitigation:
- Parallel development approach
- Comprehensive testing and staging
- Documentation and knowledge sharing

WHEN TO IMPLEMENT
=================

Triggers for Phase 3:
- Approaching 30+ devices in testing
- Need for enterprise deployment
- Performance requirements exceed current architecture
- Team has bandwidth for 1-2 month project

Current Status (Phase 2 is sufficient until):
- Testing remains under 20 devices
- Core feature development is priority
- Team focused on product functionality

ESTIMATED EFFORT
================

Total: 1-2 months with 1 developer
- Research: 1-2 weeks
- Development: 3-4 weeks  
- Testing: 1-2 weeks
- Deployment: 1 week

Skills Required:
- ReactPHP experience
- WebSocket protocol knowledge
- Laravel service provider patterns
- Performance testing and optimization

CONCLUSION
==========

Phase 3 represents a significant architectural improvement that will:
- Eliminate current scaling bottlenecks
- Provide enterprise-grade performance
- Simplify deployment and maintenance
- Enable 100+ device deployments

However, the current Phase 2 architecture is excellent for:
- Development and testing (up to 20 devices)
- Feature development focus
- Proven stability and performance

Recommendation: Continue with Phase 2 until approaching scale limits or enterprise deployment requirements.
